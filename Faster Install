## 🚀 Installation (The One-Line Method)
Follow these steps to "Behead" your server and bring the Zombie online.

1. **Download and Prepare**: Paste this into your terminal to 
    download the master installer and give it permission to run:
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markvx1irondestroyer-hub/-MERCURY-THE-FULL-HEADLESS-ZOMBIE-EDITION-v1.2-/main/install-headless.sh && chmod +x install-headless.sh

2. **Execute the Beheading**: Run the script to install drivers and disable the GUI:
   ./install-headless.sh

3. **Reboot & Wake**: After the system reboots headless, wake the stack:
   m up
### While the "One-Line Method" handles the heavy lifting of installing drivers 
And deploying containers, your server is not truly functional yet. 
You must complete several manual configuration steps to link these apps together and secure your data.
If you are having trouble setting the services up or need to transfer files. use m gui-on to to temporarily 
Return to Desktop the m gui-off when finished 
✅ FINAL MISSION: THE "YOU'RE NOT DONE" CHECKLIST
The script finished, but the Zombie needs a soul. Complete these steps in order:
1. Secure the Command Center (Portainer)
 * Action: Open http://your-ip:9443 on your phone browser.
 * Task: Create your admin password immediately to prevent unauthorized access to your containers.
2. Sync the "Arr" Empire (Prowlarr)
 * Action: Go to http://your-ip:9696.
 * Task:
   * Add your indexers (torrent sites/trackers).
   * Navigate to Settings > Apps and add Sonarr and Radarr.
   * Copy the API Keys from the "General" settings of Sonarr/Radarr and paste them into Prowlarr to link them.
3. Claim Your Library (Jellyfin & Jellyseerr)
 * Action: Open Jellyfin (http://your-ip:8096) first to create your media libraries (Movies/TV).
 * Action: Open Jellyseerr (http://your-ip:5055).
 * Task: Use your Jellyfin login to sign in, then follow the setup wizard to link your Radarr and Sonarr instances using their API keys.
4. Lock the Vault (Hard Drive)
 * Action: If you haven't already, run ./mount-vault.sh.
 * Task: Verify your external drive is mounted to /media/linux/Expansion so Jellyfin can actually see your movies.
5. Remote Control: TTYD 
 * Go to: 7681 and setup TTYD Web UI for Terminal Control 
6. Remote Access: Tailscale (https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines)
 * Authenticate and Connect ​Log In: If you haven't already, open your browser and sign in.
 * Make to setup your server PC as an Exit Node to access your web UIs off your local Network 
 * ​The "Magic" IP: Every device gets a unique, stable 100.x.y.z IP address. 
 * This stays the same regardless of what network you’re on.
 * ​Check the Console: Visit your Tailscale Admin Console to see all your connected devices in one list.
 * ​tailscale status: See what else is on your network.
 * ​tailscale ip -4: Quickly grab your Tailscale IPv4 address.
 * ​tailscale ping <device-name>: Test the connection and see if it's a direct "peer-to-peer" link.

To make your media stack work as one unit, the apps must "talk" to each other using API keys. 
Use this list to find every key you need.
​1. Sonarr & Radarr API Keys
​These keys allow Prowlarr and Jellyseerr to send movie and show requests to your downloaders.
​Where to look: Open the app (Port 8989 for Sonarr / 7878 for Radarr).
​Path: Go to Settings ➔ General.
​The Key: Look for the Security section. The "API Key" is a long string of random letters and numbers.
​2. Prowlarr API Key
​This key is required if you want to manage Prowlarr from another app or a custom dashboard.
​Where to look: Open Prowlarr (Port 9696).
​Path: Go to Settings ➔ General.
​The Key: Copy the code found in the API Key field.
​3. Jellyfin API Key
​This key allows Jellyseerr to see your "Watch History" and current library.
​Where to look: Open Jellyfin (Port 8096).
​Path: Go to Administration ➔ Dashboard ➔ Advanced ➔ API Keys.
​Task: Click the + New API Key button and name it "Jellyseerr" to generate your code.
​4. Jellyseerr API Key
​Used for integrating your request hub with third-party dashboards or mobile apps.
​Where to look: Open Jellyseerr (Port 5055).
Path: Go to Settings ➔ General.
​The Key: Look for the API Key field near the top of the page.
       
    ​💡 PRO-TIPS FOR CONFIGURATION
Add a tab file on your phone browser and add all your Web UI as favorites for fast access and control 
​Copy/Paste Only: Never type these keys by hand. One wrong character will cause a "Connection Failed" error.
​Test the Connection: Every app has a "Test" button next to the API Key field. 
Always click it until you see a green checkmark before clicking "Save".
​Regenerate if Leaked: If you accidentally show your API key in a screenshot online,
use the Regenerate button (the arrows next to the key) to create a new one immediately.
