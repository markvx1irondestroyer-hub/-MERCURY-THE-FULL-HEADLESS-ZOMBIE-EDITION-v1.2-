## 🚀 Installation (The One-Line Method)
⚠️ Critical: The "Mount-First" Rule
​In a Docker-based environment, the order of operations is everything. You must always ensure your 
external drives are mounted and (optionally) mount-vault.sh before running the m up command.
​Why this matters:
​When Docker starts a container with a volume mapping (e.g., /media/linux/Expansion), it looks for 
that folder on your host system.
If the drive is NOT mounted: Docker will see an empty directory on your OS Drive. It will "helpfully" create 
that folder and start writing your 50GB movies directly to your small SSD/Boot drive, filling it up and crashing your OS.
The "Ghost" Effect: If you mount the drive after Docker has started, the real drive will "cover up" the folders Docker created. 
You won't see your files, and you'll be left wondering why your disk space is disappearing.
Follow these steps to "Behead" your server and bring the Zombie online.

1. **Download and Prepare**: Paste this into your terminal to [note if it says sudo apt install git run that first]
    download the master installer and give it permission to run:
   git clone https://github.com/markvx1irondestroyer-hub/-MERCURY-THE-FULL-HEADLESS-ZOMBIE-EDITION-v1.2-.git mercury && cd mercury

2. **Execute the Beheading**: Run the script to install drivers and disable the GUI:
  chmod +x install-headless.sh && ./install-headless.sh
3. If you want the external storage and status check enter this this first you can remove one if you want
    chmod +x status.sh mount-vault.sh
   Then run the 2 scripts 1 by 1
    ./status.sh
    ./mount-vault.sh
#### make sure to copy Follow to ⚠️ Copy the UUID for your Expansion drive (e.g., 1234-ABCD).
     it will be shown in the list make sure to select the correct drive copy and paste it hit enter

4. **Reboot & Wake**: After the system reboots headless, Build the stack:
   m gui-on to finish setup on Desktop
#### ONCE YOU HAVE COMPLETED EVERYTHING#####
 This includes check your your docker compose before launch make sure youre TimeZone code is correct
and if you have previous Config files make sure to swap them before launching
 Its time to Raise the Dead m up to launch the Zombie Media Stack
### While the "One-Line Method" handles the heavy lifting of installing drivers 
And deploying containers, your server is not truly functional yet. 
You must complete several manual configuration steps to link these apps together and secure your data.
If you are having trouble or need to transfer files. use m gui-on to to temporarily 
Return to Desktop the m gui-off when finished 
✅ FINAL MISSION: THE "YOU'RE NOT DONE" CHECKLIST
The script finished, but the Zombie needs a soul. Complete these steps in order:
1. Secure the Command Center (Portainer)
 * Action: Open http://your-ip:9443 on your phone browser.
 * Task: Create your admin password immediately to prevent unauthorized access to your containers.
2. Sync the "Arr" Empire (Prowlarr)
 * Action: Go to http://your-ip:9696.
 * Task:
   * Add your indexers (torrent sites/trackers).
   * Navigate to Settings > Apps and add Sonarr and Radarr.
   * Copy the API Keys from the "General" settings of Sonarr/Radarr and paste them into Prowlarr to link them.
3. Claim Your Library (Jellyfin & Jellyseerr)
 * Action: Open Jellyfin (http://your-ip:8096) first to create your media libraries (Movies/TV).
 * Action: Open Jellyseerr (http://your-ip:5055).
 * Task: Use your Jellyfin login to sign in, then follow the setup wizard to link your Radarr and Sonarr instances using their API keys.
4. LockDown the Vault (Hard Drive)
 * Task: Verify your external drive is mounted to /media/linux/Expansion so Jellyfin can actually see your movies.
5. Remote Control: TTYD 
 * Go to: 7681 and setup TTYD Web UI for Terminal Control 
6. Remote Access: Tailscale (https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines)
 * Authenticate and Connect ​Log In: If you haven't already, open your browser and sign in.
 * Make to setup your server PC as an Exit Node to access your web UIs off your local Network 
 * ​The "Magic" IP: Every device gets a unique, stable 100.x.y.z IP address. 
 * This stays the same regardless of what network you’re on.
 * ​Check the Console: Visit your Tailscale Admin Console to see all your connected devices in one list.
 * ​tailscale status: See what else is on your network.
 * ​tailscale ip -4: Quickly grab your Tailscale IPv4 address.
 * ​tailscale ping <device-name>: Test the connection and see if it's a direct "peer-to-peer" link.

To make your media stack work as one unit, the apps must "talk" to each other using API keys. 
Use this list to find every key you need.
​1. Sonarr & Radarr API Keys
​These keys allow Prowlarr and Jellyseerr to send movie and show requests to your downloaders.
​Where to look: Open the app (Port 8989 for Sonarr / 7878 for Radarr).
​Path: Go to Settings ➔ General.
​The Key: Look for the Security section. The "API Key" is a long string of random letters and numbers.
​2. Prowlarr API Key
​This key is required if you want to manage Prowlarr from another app or a custom dashboard.
​Where to look: Open Prowlarr (Port 9696).
​Path: Go to Settings ➔ General.
​The Key: Copy the code found in the API Key field.
​3. Jellyfin API Key
​This key allows Jellyseerr to see your "Watch History" and current library.
​Where to look: Open Jellyfin (Port 8096).
​Path: Go to Administration ➔ Dashboard ➔ Advanced ➔ API Keys.
​Task: Click the + New API Key button and name it "Jellyseerr" to generate your code.
​4. Jellyseerr API Key
​Used for integrating your request hub with third-party dashboards or mobile apps.
​Where to look: Open Jellyseerr (Port 5055).
Path: Go to Settings ➔ General.
​The Key: Look for the API Key field near the top of the page.
🏗️ The Mercury Architecture: Quarantine & Vault Logic
The Built in extra locations are redundant and can be ignored if only using one Hard drive but they 
Allow for expansion and upgrades later if you want to add extra storage later just make sure all 
folders exist in the drive you're using 
​Unlike standard "hardlink" setups that prioritize speed, the Mercury Server is designed for 
Data Integrity and Hardware Longevity. It treats storage as two distinct zones to 
protect the primary collection from corruption and "bad" data.
​☣️ Zone 1: The Quarantine (Torrents Drive)
​Purpose: All active and completed downloads reside here.
​Risk Mitigation: Torrenting can be intensive on drive headers and carries a higher risk of "bad" or 
corrupted files. If this drive fails or the filesystem (exFAT/NTFS) corrupts due to high I/O, the permanent 
library remains untouched.
​The Logic: We intentionally use Copy + Delete (instead of Atomic Moves). In the event of a power failure or 
system crash during a transfer, the original file is preserved in the Quarantine until the copy is verified in the Vault.
​🏛️ Zone 2: The Vault (Expansion Drive)
​Purpose: The curated, "approved" library.
​Safety: This drive only sees sequential write operations when a movie is "promoted" from Quarantine. This minimizes 
fragmentation and extends the physical life of the drive.
    
    ​💡 PRO-TIPS FOR CONFIGURATION
Add a tab file on your phone browser and add all your Web UI as favorites for fast access and control 
​Copy/Paste Only: Never type these keys by hand. One wrong character will cause a "Connection Failed" error.
​Test the Connection: Every app has a "Test" button next to the API Key field. 
Always click it until you see a green checkmark before clicking "Save".
​Regenerate if Leaked: If you accidentally show your API key in a screenshot online,
use the Regenerate button (the arrows next to the key) to create a new one immediately.
     **ONCE and IF successful Congratulations 🎊 👏 Enjoy 😁
