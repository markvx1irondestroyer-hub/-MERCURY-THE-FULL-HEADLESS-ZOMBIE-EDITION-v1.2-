## 🚀 Installation (The One-Line Method)
Follow these steps to "Behead" your server and bring the Zombie online.

1. **Download and Prepare**: Paste this into your terminal to download the master installer and give it permission to run:
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markvx1irondestroyer-hub/-MERCURY-THE-FULL-HEADLESS-ZOMBIE-EDITION-v1.2-/main/install-headless.sh && chmod +x install-headless.sh

2. **Execute the Beheading**: Run the script to install drivers and disable the GUI:
   ./install-headless.sh

3. **Reboot & Wake**: After the system reboots headless, wake the stack:
   m up
### While the "One-Line Method" handles the heavy lifting of installing drivers and deploying containers, your server is not truly functional yet. You must complete several manual configuration steps to link these apps together and secure your data.
Add this "Final Mission" section to the bottom of your README to ensure users cross the finish line successfully.
✅ FINAL MISSION: THE "YOU'RE NOT DONE" CHECKLIST
The script finished, but the Zombie needs a soul. Complete these steps in order:
1. Secure the Command Center (Portainer)
 * Action: Open http://your-ip:9443 on your phone browser.
 * Task: Create your admin password immediately to prevent unauthorized access to your containers.
2. Sync the "Arr" Empire (Prowlarr)
 * Action: Go to http://your-ip:9696.
 * Task:
   * Add your indexers (torrent sites/trackers).
   * Navigate to Settings > Apps and add Sonarr and Radarr.
   * Copy the API Keys from the "General" settings of Sonarr/Radarr and paste them into Prowlarr to link them.
3. Claim Your Library (Jellyfin & Jellyseerr)
 * Action: Open Jellyfin (http://your-ip:8096) first to create your media libraries (Movies/TV).
 * Action: Open Jellyseerr (http://your-ip:5055).
 * Task: Use your Jellyfin login to sign in, then follow the setup wizard to link your Radarr and Sonarr instances using their API keys.
4. Lock the Vault (Hard Drive)
 * Action: If you haven't already, run ./mount-vault.sh.
 * Task: Verify your external drive is mounted to /media/linux/Expansion so Jellyfin can actually see your movies.
